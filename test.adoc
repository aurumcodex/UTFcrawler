'''
== About
'''
This is a project that is designed to create an RPG game using Unicode characters as ASCII art, instead of using raw ASCII.
This effectively makes the display ANSI art, rather than ASCII art.

Support for RGB colors is required for the best experience, but a plain terminal should do fine.
//A QWERTY layout or similar keyboard is highly recommended for a proper experience

'''

== Dependencies
'''
For installation, the following dependencies are required:

* A working installation of `rust`, `rustc`, and `cargo`.
** This is supplied either via the `rustup` script available link:https://rustup.rs/[here].
*** Or it's supplied by your package managers for your Linux distro of choice.
* `git` to fetch this repository

'''

== Installation
'''
==== Compiling from Source
Simple enough:

* Clone the repository: `git clone \https://gitlab.com/utf-crawler/utf-crawler.git`
* Move into cloned folder: `cd utf-crawler`
* Build: `cargo install`
** Or for a more manual approach:
*** `cargo build --release`
*** and move/copy `./target/release` to your `$PATH`.
