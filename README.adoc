'''
== About
'''
This is a project that is designed to create an RPG game using Unicode characters as ASCII art, 
instead of using raw ASCII.
This effectively makes the display ANSI art, rather than ASCII art.

Support for RGB colors is required for the best experience, but a plain terminal should do fine. +
A monospaced font supporting a high number of Unicode characters is *highly* recommended, as that 
will allow the maps to render properly.

A QWERTY layout or similar keyboard/keymap is highly recommended for a proper experience
A treminal size of 103 cols x 30 lines is recommended for the maps to display correctly.

NOTE: This project was built with Rust version 1.30.0, but should work with any future versions.

'''

== Dependencies
'''
For installation, the following dependencies are required:

* A working installation of `rust`, `rustc`, and `cargo`.
** This is supplied either via the `rustup` script available link:https://rustup.rs/[here].
*** Or it's supplied by your package managers for your Linux/Unix distro of choice.
*** (It is highly recommended to unstall `rust` via the `rustup` script mentioned above.)
* `git` to fetch this repository

'''

== Installation
'''
==== Compiling from Source
* Clone the repository: `git clone \https://gitlab.com/utf-crawler/utf-crawler.git`
* Move into cloned folder: `cd utf-crawler`
* Build: `cargo install`
** Or for a more manual approach:
*** `cargo build --release`
*** and move/copy `./target/release` to your `$PATH`.
*** or add it to your `$PATH` in some form.

'''

==== From link:crates.io[crates.io]
* Since this project is also on crates.io, the same hosting service used for the dependencies,
  all you need then is `cargo install utf-crawler`, once you have `rust` and `cargo` installed.
